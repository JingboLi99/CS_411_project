# The Mindful Chef

I found a major lack of english resources online for chinese cooking. Despite its large variability, the free recipes available online are primarily catered towards "American Chinese" cuisine, and not very authentic. 

The solution was to scrape youtube and chinese recipe websites for authentic recipes; collate them based on cuisine type and skill for a more structured pedagogy; and translate the information to english using google translate API.

The scraping tool is built using Selenium Chromedriver and BeautifulSoup.
The backend is written in Django, linked in MySQL frontend.
